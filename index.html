            One of the three cornerstone languages used in web development. Used
            to create the structure of a webpage!
          </h4>
          <h4>A webpage is composed of elements that work together.</h4>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Elements are a type of content</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing
                tag represented with angle brackets (< >)
              </li>
              <li>Tag: refers to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
              <li>Types of elements:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Meta-related elements</li>
                <li>
                  Semantic elements (the name of the element describes its
                  content and the role it plays on a webpage. Ex. body, section)
                </li>
                <li>Non semantic</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Content division elements (Ex. div, span)</li>
                  <li>Heading (Ex. h1,h2)</li>
                  <li>Lists (Ex. ul, ol, li)</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>
              Elements are composed of tags and can have attributes. Tags
              contain the content if open and closed!
            </li>
            <li>Nesting elements: Putting elements inside other elements.</li>
            <li>
              Void elements: elements with no content, just attributes and dont
              have a closing tag. Ex img ([img src="images/firefox-icon.png"
              alt="My test image"])
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Basic elements:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                HTML: its the root of the document, contains the lang element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Body: contains the content that is shown to the user. All the
                elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be
                placed inside this element
              </li>
              <li>
                Head: contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser
                to render the page correctly. Elements included within the
                [head] are not visible when a user looks at a webpage
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Usually the head element includes the following elements:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Meta: contains information about the page that is used by
                    the browser, defines metadata such as the character set,
                    description, keywords, author, and viewport.
                  </li>
                  <li>Title: defines the title for a webpage</li>
                  <li>Style: defines the CSS styles associated</li>
                  <li>Base: defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
                  <li>
                    Link: connects an external resource to the HTML document
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Script: embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Main: represents the dominant content of the [body] of a
                document. The content inside the [main] element should be unique
                to the document
              </li>
              <li>
                Footer: contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and
                navigation
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>Most common elements inside body element:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>src: defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
              <li>
                img: contains information about images that are displayed on the

            Is a style sheet programming language used by developers to define

          </h4>
          <h4>
            Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a
            webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and
            organization.
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Css is a Stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
            document written in HTML or XML.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in
            speech, or on other media.
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h4>
            Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting
            on top of other boxes. CSS layout is mostly based on the box model.

          <h4>Each box taking up space on your page has properties.</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Ways to style a webpage using css:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inline: style an element directly in the HTML file. Quick and
                permanent changes, but not flexible!
              </li>
              <li>
                Internal/ Embedded: You can use the [style] element in the
                [head] element to put an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML
                file.
              </li>
              <li>
                External: most common, allows developers to keep all their CSS
                rules in a separate file. We link the file using a [link]
                element placed in the HTML's [head]
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>CSS rules:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules
                will apply
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Types of selectors:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Element selector: All HTML elements of the specified type.
                    Ex my-element
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ID selector: The element on the page with the specified ID.
                    Ex #my-id
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Class selector: The element(s) on the page with the
                    specified class. Ex .my-class
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Attribute selector: The element(s) on the page with the
                    specified attribute. Ex img[src]
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Pseudo-class selector: The specified element(s), but only
                    when in the specified state. Ex a:hover
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

                Declarations: Contains the property we want to apply and the
                value of the property
              </li>
              <li>Property: ways in which you can style an element</li>
              <li>Property value: appearance for the given property</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>Most common rules:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Display (inline vs block)</li>
              <li>Margin: space outside an element</li>
              <li>
                Padding: space inside an element (if you increase the padding,
                you are making the element bigger)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li>DRY CODE: Do Not Repeat Yourself</li>
            <li>
              Coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share
              pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that
              need to be written or maintained
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>CSS is usually linked with the link element</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Link: creates the connection to the external file</li>
              <li>
                Rel: attribute that specifies the relationship between the

            <ul>
              <li>
                Block (ex. body) - displayed as blocks, one on top of the other

            JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your

          </h4>
          <br />
          <li>
            The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
            programming features that allow us to:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Store values inside variables</li>
            <li>Operations on strings</li>
            <li>Run code in response to certain events</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>JS has functionalities built on top of the client-side:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): ready-made sets of code
              building blocks, allow devs to implement programs.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Categories:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to
                  expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do
                  useful complex things.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default,
                  and you generally have to grab their code and information from
                  somewhere on the Web
                </li>
              </ul>

          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            The html, css and js are run in an execution environment (the
            browser tab). Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run
            before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Types of code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interpreted code: the code is run from top to bottom and the
              result of running the code is immediately returned. Ex javascript
            </li>
            <li>
              Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled)
              into another form before they are run by the computer. Ex C++
            </li>
            <li>
              Client-side code: code is downloaded, runs on the user’s computer
              and then is displayed. Ex vanilla javascript
            </li>

              Server-side code: runs on the server, results are downloaded and
              displayed in the browser. Ex .NET or Node.js (javascript)
            </li>
            <li>Dynamic: ability to update the display of the webpage</li>
            <li>Static: shows the same content all the time.</li>

              Defer attribute tells the browser to continue downloading the html
              content once the script tag has been reached.
            </li>
            <li>Both the script and the html will load simultaneously!</li>

            Features to bypass blocking script (they instruct the browser):
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your scripts should run immediately and dont have dependencies?

            <ul>
              <li>
                Async: Scripts loaded using the async attribute will download
                the script without blocking the page while the script is being
                fetched. However, once the download is complete, the script will
                execute, which blocks the page from rendering.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Your scripts need to wait for the DOM?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Defer: Scripts loaded with the defer attribute will load in the
                order they appear on the page. They won't run until the page
                content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend
                on the DOM being in place.
