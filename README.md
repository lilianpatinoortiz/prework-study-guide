# Lilian's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This small project was, apart from being the first introduction to the bootcamp, a great way to study the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript!
I built this project to get a general idea of how to build a webpage and use git - which is used in many companies for controlling the versions of the code.
In this project are included some of the notes I took during as I followed the modules, sumarized in the key points for each section.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
